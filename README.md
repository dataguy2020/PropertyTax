# PropertyTax
This script is set up to pull public avaiable data for the community of Tanyard Springs and to calculate the house assessment, the 2% and 10% caps allowed by Anne Arundel County & the State of Maryland, along with the property tax payment (yearly) that is needed for each of the homes. 

## TO DO
* Clean- up functions
* Calculate property taxes that are due in a annual payment setup
* Calculate property taxes that are due in a semi annual payment setup
* Expand the script to include Baltimore City, Baltimore County, Howard County, Calvert County, Kent County, Prince George's, Queen Anne's and Talbot
* Expand the script to include the rest of the Eastern Shore
* Expand the script to include western Maryland Counties
* Expand the script to include the rest of Maryland Counties that are not listed


### Notes
* Under the two-payment plan, the local governments may add a service fee of up to 1.65% of the second payment to your tax bill. This amount is to compensate the local government for lost interest and additional administrative expenses of sending two tax bills. This fee will be added to the second payment.
