# PropertyTax
This script is set up to pull public avaiable data for the community of Tanyard Springs (currently) and to calculate the house assessment, the 2% and 10% caps allowed by Anne Arundel County & the State of Maryland, along with the property tax payment (yearly) and semi-annual payment that is needed for each of the homes. 

You have will have to obtain your own personal authentication token from https://opendata.maryland.gov. There is an example auth.py.example. This file will need to be updated and then renamed to auth.py.

# Notes
* Under the two-payment plan, the local governments may add a service fee of up to 1.65% of the second payment to your tax bill. This amount is to compensate the local government for lost interest and additional administrative expenses of sending two tax bills. This fee will be added to the second payment.
